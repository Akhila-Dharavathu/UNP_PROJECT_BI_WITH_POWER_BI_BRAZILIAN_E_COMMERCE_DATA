# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

I worked on the Brazilian E-commerce Dashboard in collaboration with UNP to help businesses better understand online shopping trends, customer behavior, and overall performance. The dashboard breaks down key insights, like the total number of orders, preferred payment methods, and the most popular products and sellers. It also keeps track of customer reviews, sentiment analysis, and user engagement, helping businesses pinpoint what drives customer satisfaction. Beyond that, it looks at order trends over time, delivery performance, and regional sales distribution, giving a clearer picture of how e-commerce is evolving in Brazil. On the financial side, the dashboard analyzes total revenue, payment trends, and how customer ratings affect sales. With these insights, businesses can fine-tune their strategies, improve the customer experience, and make smarter decisions in the competitive e-commerceÂ space.
